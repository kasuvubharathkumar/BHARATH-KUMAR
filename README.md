Our project centers around three key tables: Customer, Transactions, and Prod_cat_info. The Customer table offers detailed profiles of our clientele, enabling us to understand demographics, preferences, and purchase behaviors. Transactions provides a wealth of information on sales trends, top-selling products, and buying patterns over time. Meanwhile, Prod_cat_info sheds light on product categories, brands, and attributes, empowering us to optimize product assortment and marketing strategies.

Through rigorous SQL analysis, we aim to extract actionable insights that drive strategic decision-making and enhance business performance in the competitive e-commerce landscape. Join us on this journey as we navigate through data-driven discoveries and unlock the potential of e-commerce retail analytics."
